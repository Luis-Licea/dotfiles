    ; Merge commits obfuscate intent. Pull requests should not include merge
    ; commits. If there are local changes, always fetch and rebase. The commits
    ; should be applied directly on the of the master branch. It may be
    ; necessary to stash the changes before rebasing.
    ;
    ; Also, git fetch --all is only necessary when there are changes on the
    ; remote, but type it as often as possible. There is nothing worse than
    ; spending an eternity rebasing on an old cache of origin/master
    nevermerge = !git fetch --all && git rebase -i origin/master

    ; Why do people find git hard?
    gitiseasy = !git submodule foreach git reset --hard HEAD && git submodule foreach git pull origin master

    ; Notes: When using git reset, use --soft instead of --hard to change the
    ; git state without modifying any files or work.

    ; Other commands.
    ; git fetch remote master
    ; git pull remote master
    ; git reset remote/master
    ; git reset --soft remote/master
    ;
    ; To open a PR, it is necessary to first push changes to origin, but that
    ; may delete old commits if --force is used. Using a branch may seem the
    ; only way to open a PR. The solution is to rebase your work on top of
    ; master. Alternatively create a new branch based on master, and
    ; cherry-pick the one fix commit.
    ; git cherry-pick deadbeefyourfixcommit
