% This is an example configuration file that provides a `less' emulation
% for MOST.
%
% The format is simple:
%       setkey <function-name> <key-name>
%       unsetkey <key-name>
%       color <object-name> <fg> <bg>
%
% Here <key-name> must be enclosed in double quotes.  '^' represents Ctrl.
% The function name is not in double quotes.
%
%
% When MOST starts up, it looks for a keymap file given by the environment
% variable MOST_INITFILE.  If that environment variable does not exist,
% MOST will look in the users HOME directory for .mostrc on Unix systems
% and MOST.RC on VMS systems.
%
% The file `most.rc' contains a listing of the default MOST keybindings.

% Color settings

% For a black background, replace none with black.
color normal lightgray none
color status yellow blue none
color underline brightgreen none
color overstrike brightred none

% Keybindings. Use CTRL+G to abort search, finding files, etc.

% Vim-like keybindings.
